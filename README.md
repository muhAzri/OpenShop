# OpenShop Products API

A RESTful API for product management built with Django REST Framework. This API provides comprehensive CRUD operations for e-commerce product management with features like soft delete, search functionality, and HATEOAS compliance.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Product Management**: Complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Soft Delete**: Products are marked as deleted rather than permanently removed
- **Search Capabilities**: Search products by name and location with partial matching
- **UUID-based IDs**: Uses UUID4 for product identification
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive field validation with detailed error messages
- **HATEOAS Support**: Hypermedia links for API discoverability

### Technical Features
- **Django REST Framework**: Built on industry-standard REST framework
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight database for development and testing
- **Admin Interface**: Django admin panel for product management
- **API Documentation**: Postman collection for comprehensive testing
- **Proper HTTP Status Codes**: Correct status codes for all operations
- **Standardized Responses**: Consistent JSON response format for easy frontend integration
- **Frontend-Friendly**: Unified response structure with success flags and clear error handling

## Admin Interface

Access the Django admin interface at `http://localhost:8000/admin/`

**Default Admin Credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

### Admin Features
- View all products in organized table format
- Search products by name, SKU, description, shop, location
- Filter products by availability, category, shop, location
- Inline editing for stock, price, discount, availability
- Bulk soft delete operations
- Organized fieldsets for better data entry

## Testing

### Postman Collection
Import the provided Postman collection for comprehensive API testing:
- `OpenShop Products API.postman_collection.json`

### Test Coverage
The Postman collection includes tests for:
- ✅ All CRUD operations
- ✅ Data validation scenarios
- ✅ Error handling (400, 404)
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ HATEOAS link validation
- ✅ Soft delete verification

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test server health
curl http://localhost:8000/products/

# Test invalid UUID handling
curl http://localhost:8000/products/invalid-id/

# Test validation errors
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/products/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "", "price": -100}'
```

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- `Django 4.2.23`: Web framework
- `djangorestframework`: REST API framework

### Development Dependencies
- `requests`: For API testing scripts

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application uses Django's default settings. For production deployment, consider configuring:
- `DEBUG = False`
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` with your domain
- Database configuration (PostgreSQL recommended)
- Secret key management

### Database
Currently configured with SQLite for development. The database file `db.sqlite3` is created automatically when running migrations.

## API Design Principles

### RESTful Design
- Uses appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Resource-based URLs
- JSON content type

### HATEOAS Implementation
All product responses include `_links` array with:
- Self-referential links
- Related action links (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- Proper HTTP methods and content types

### Soft Delete Pattern
- Products are never permanently deleted
- `is_delete` flag marks deleted products
- Deleted products are filtered from all GET requests
- Admin interface can restore deleted products

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- Single product model (no categories, variants)
- Basic search (no full-text search, filters)
- No authentication/authorization
- No pagination for large datasets
- No image upload handling
- No inventory tracking beyond stock count

### Potential Enhancements
- User authentication and permissions
- Advanced search with filters
- Image upload and management
- Product categories and tags
- Inventory management system
- Order management integration
- API rate limiting
- Caching for better performance
- Real-time stock updates
- Bulk operations support

**Note**: This is a development project focused on demonstrating RESTful API design with Django REST Framework. For production use, additional security, scalability, and monitoring considerations should be implemented.
